    \nThis is a fixed carrier frequency channelizer. \n\nYou may not use this block\
    \ directly but the wrapping hier block gr-FDC.FrequencyDomainChannelizer\n\n *\
    \ Input is a complex vector of length blocklen, containing blockwise overlapped\
    \ fouriertransformed signal\n * Output is message or file based\n \n * ID is used\
    \ for unique signal identification. Non-unique IDs with multiple blocks may lead\
    \ to conflicts, but is unlikely.\n * Blocklen is input vector length\n * Normalized\
    \ carrierfreq is Mid frequency of the desired channel. Range from [0.0,1.0], representing\
    \ 0.0 to samp_rate\n * Normalized bandwidth represents the minimum output channel\
    \ bandwidth. Care: To suffice parameters, output bandwidth is adjusted during\
    \ initialization\n * Rel. inverse Overlap is the inverse of the used overlap in\
    \ the input vector. It must be a power of 2, typically 4 is chosen, but not necessarily.\
    \ \n * Threshold is the minimum power difference in dB in consecutive blocks to\
    \ activate and deactivate the channel. \n * Maximum Blocks smaller 0 leads to\
    \ only emit messages if the channel end is detected. Equal 0, every block is emitted,\
    \ greater 0, the according size of blocks is determined as a maximum puffered\
    \ blocknumber and the data to that point is emitted with according flags.   \n\
    \ * Deactivation delay is currently not implemented in PowerActivationChannel.\n\
    \ * Message output determines if the channel data should be emitted via Gnuradio\
    \ message passing\n * File output determines if the channel data should be emitted\
    \ as a file\n * Outputfiles is the path to store the channel data if File output\
    \ is true\n * Log/verbose destination specifies if and how the activity should\
    \ be logged.\n    * None means no logging at all, choose this for maximum runtime\
    \ efficiency. \n    * Print to console prints all gathered information to console.\
    \ with many concurrent channelizers, this might mean a lot of messages.\n    *\
    \ Log to file logs the complete output to a file in your home dir or from whereever\
    \ you instantiated the top_block\n\nIf you have any trouble, let me know or feel\
    \ free to contribute @ github.com/gereonsuch/gr-FDC"
